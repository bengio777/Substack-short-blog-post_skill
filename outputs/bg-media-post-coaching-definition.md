- **Description:** Coach the author through transforming raw media (video, photo, audio) into a tight, engaging, multimedia-rich Substack post (~5 minute read) that blends storytelling with insight
- **Outcome:** A published Substack post — concise, multimedia-native, story + lesson format
- **Trigger:** Author has a piece of media (video, photo, or audio) and the impulse to create a post
- **Type:** Augmented (AI coaches and assists, human makes creative decisions)
- **Business Objective:** Develop a consistent content creation practice, build storytelling craft through repetition, and grow confidence in publishing multimedia personal narratives
- **Current Owner(s):** Benjamin Giordano (Substack: bengio777)

## Refined Steps

### Step 1: Select Source Media

- **Action:** Choose the piece(s) of media that will spark the post
- **Sub-steps:**
  1. Browse media across sources (phone camera roll, iCloud, computer folders) or arrive with a specific piece already in mind
  2. Apply the selection filter — does this media trigger an emotional reaction, carry a story behind it, or have strong aesthetic/visual quality?
  3. Confirm selection — single piece or a collection from the same experience
- **Decision Points:**
  - Browsing mode vs. "I already know what I want to post about"
  - Single piece vs. collection — does this experience need multiple media to tell the story?
- **Data In:** Raw media library (phone camera roll, iCloud, local folders)
- **Data Out:** Selected media file(s) for the post
- **Context Needs:** Access to the author's media across devices/storage locations
- **Failure Modes:**
  - Nothing in the library sparks a post — no emotional, narrative, or aesthetic trigger fires
  - Too many options lead to decision paralysis

### Step 2: Extract the Story from the Media

- **Action:** Automatically analyze the selected media and surface potential story angles for the author to choose from
- **Sub-steps:**
  1. Process media technically — transcribe audio/video, extract photo metadata (location, date, camera settings), describe visual content
  2. Identify 2-3 possible story angles based on the analysis (emotional angle, lesson-learned angle, experiential angle, etc.)
  3. Present story angles to the author for selection
- **Decision Points:**
  - Author chooses which story angle to pursue
  - Author may volunteer additional context not captured in the media ("this was the day I learned X" or "we had just arrived in Y")
- **Data In:** Selected media file(s) from Step 1
- **Data Out:** Media analysis (transcription, metadata, visual description) + chosen story angle
- **Context Needs:** The author's personal context about when/why the media was captured — information not embedded in the file itself
- **Failure Modes:**
  - Media doesn't contain enough story material to sustain a ~5 minute read
  - Transcription misses the point or misinterprets audio/video content
  - None of the proposed story angles resonate with the author

---

### Step 3: Coach the Story Structure

- **Action:** Using the chosen story angle, coach the author through building the narrative using the Amuse-Bouche framework
- **Sub-steps:**
  1. Identify the Anchor — "What's the single memorable moment?" The surprising fact, revelation, or twist that justifies the whole piece
  2. Build the Essential Details — only what's needed to set up the Anchor. "An amuse-bouche, not a 7-course meal"
  3. Craft the Dismount — satisfying conclusion, call-to-action, or callback to the opening
  4. Write the Hook last — now that we know where the story goes, choose from: Dialogue, Snapshot, Bold Statement, Emotional, or Question hook
- **Decision Points:**
  - At each stage, the author makes the creative call — the skill proposes, the author reacts and refines
  - "Here's a possible anchor moment — does that feel right, or is the real moment something else?"
  - Hook type selection — which of the 5 types fits this story best?
- **Data In:** Chosen story angle + media analysis + author's personal context
- **Data Out:** Complete narrative structure — Hook, Essential Details, Anchor, Dismount
- **Context Needs:**
  - Amuse-Bouche framework (4-part structure with rules and examples)
  - 5 Hook Types reference (Dialogue, Snapshot, Bold Statement, Emotional, Question)
  - 5-minute read guidelines (~1,200-1,500 words, section balance)
- **Failure Modes:**
  - Author can't identify the anchor — the "so what?" moment isn't clear
  - Essential details balloon — the "writing a whole book" problem
  - Author gets stuck at a stage and needs additional coaching to move forward

---

### Step 4/5: Draft the Post with Integrated Multimedia

- **Action:** Write the full draft following the coached structure, with multimedia placed intentionally to serve the story
- **Sub-steps:**
  1. Map each piece of media to a story beat — does it open the piece, anchor the climax, or close it out?
  2. Recommend presentation format — embedded photo with caption, video with lead-in line, audio clip with context
  3. Generate the draft text following the Amuse-Bouche structure with media embedded at planned positions
  4. Write captions/alt-text that extend the story rather than just describe the media
  5. Check word count against ~1,200-1,500 word target
  6. Read-through for voice — does it sound like the author or like AI?
- **Decision Points:**
  - Media placement approval — "Does this photo land better as the opener or right before the dismount?"
  - Author reviews full draft and flags what feels off — tone, length, flow, authenticity
- **Data In:** Narrative structure from Step 3 + original media files + media analysis from Step 2
- **Data Out:** Complete draft post with multimedia integrated
- **Context Needs:**
  - Multimedia placement principles (media must serve the story, authentic > overproduced, videos need captions, compress files, original media wins)
  - 5-minute read length constraint
- **Failure Modes:**
  - Media feels shoehorned rather than organic — multimedia disrupts the reading flow
  - Too many media pieces dilute the writing — becomes a slideshow, not a story
  - Draft sounds generic/AI-generated rather than authentic
  - Draft exceeds the 5-minute read target

---

### Step 6: Review and Tighten

- **Action:** Editing pass focused on brevity, engagement, and knowing when to stop. The skill acts as an editor, not a rewriter — and explains the "why" behind each suggestion to build the author's craft.
- **Sub-steps:**
  1. Flag sections that exceed their purpose — "these 3 sentences are doing the job of 1"
  2. Check the hook — is it earning the reader's next 5 minutes?
  3. Check the dismount — does it land or trail off?
  4. Trim to target length if over
  5. For each suggested edit, explain the principle behind it (coaching, not just correcting)
- **Decision Points:**
  - Author accepts, rejects, or modifies each tightening suggestion
  - Final go/no-go: "Is this post ready to publish?"
- **Data In:** Full draft from Step 4/5
- **Data Out:** Final edited post ready for formatting
- **Context Needs:**
  - Editing principles ("kill your darlings," every sentence earns its place, the "why" behind each cut)
  - Amuse-Bouche constraint — "not a 7-course meal"
- **Failure Modes:**
  - Over-editing strips the author's personality and authentic voice
  - Author resists cuts and the piece stays too long
  - Editing loop goes on too long — diminishing returns

### Step 7: Format and Publish to Substack

- **Action:** Prepare the finalized post for Substack and publish it
- **Sub-steps:**
  1. Format for Substack's editor — headings, image placement, embedded video/audio
  2. Write subtitle and preview text (the line that hooks readers in their inbox/feed)
  3. Set tags/categories
  4. Final visual preview check
  5. Publish to Substack (account: bengio777)
- **Decision Points:**
  - Author approves subtitle and preview text
  - Publish now vs. schedule for later
  - Final visual check in Substack's preview
- **Data In:** Final edited post + media files
- **Data Out:** Published Substack post (live URL)
- **Context Needs:**
  - Substack formatting guide (supported media types, embed methods, auto-distribution to YouTube/Spotify/Apple Podcasts)
  - Substack account info (bengio777)
- **Failure Modes:**
  - Formatting breaks in Substack's editor
  - Media doesn't embed properly (file size, format incompatibility)
  - Preview text doesn't hook readers

---

### Step 8: Post-Publish Reflection

- **Action:** Quick structured reflection to build self-awareness and improve over time
- **Sub-steps:**
  1. Prompt: "What felt easy?"
  2. Prompt: "Where did you get stuck?"
  3. Prompt: "What would you steal from this post for next time?"
  4. Prompt: "Rate your confidence (1-5) — how do you feel about what you just published?"
  5. Log the answers to the Reflection Log
- **Decision Points:** None — this is a learning exercise, not a decision gate
- **Data In:** The experience of creating this post
- **Data Out:** Reflection log entry
- **Context Needs:** Previous reflection entries (to surface patterns over time — "you always get stuck on dismounts")
- **Failure Modes:**
  - Author skips the reflection (feels like overhead)
  - Answers are too vague to surface actionable patterns

## Step Sequence and Dependencies

### Sequential Flow
Steps 1 → 2 → 3 → 4/5 → 6 → 7 → 8

### Parallel Steps
- Steps 4 and 5 are combined — multimedia placement and drafting happen together, not in separate passes

### Critical Path
- **Step 3 (Coach the Story Structure)** is the bottleneck — the most creative thinking, the most likely place to get stuck, and everything downstream depends on getting the structure right

### Dependency Map
| Step | Depends On | Produces For |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1. Select Source Media | Trigger (media + impulse) | Step 2 |
| 2. Extract the Story | Step 1 (selected media) | Step 3 |
| 3. Coach Story Structure | Step 2 (story angle + analysis) | Steps 4/5 |
| 4/5. Draft with Multimedia | Step 3 (structure) + Step 2 (media analysis) + Step 1 (media files) | Step 6 |
| 6. Review and Tighten | Steps 4/5 (full draft) | Step 7 |
| 7. Format and Publish | Step 6 (final post) | Step 8 |
| 8. Reflect | Step 7 (published post) | Future iterations |
